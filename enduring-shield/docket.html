						<p>Good Morning,</p>
						<p>Contained within is a briefing packet on the Republic of Fapovo; your regiment is being mobilised to support peacekeeping operations in the region.</p>

					<h1>Background Information</h1>
					<h2>Fapovo, The Democratic Federal Republic of</h2>

					<h3>Geography & Population</h3>
					<p>
						The Democratic Federal Republic of Fapovo (hereafter Fapovo), is an Atlantic Island Archipelago, population of 56,000, formed from the major island of Fapovo
						and the minor outlying islands, known as Mermaid (West), Nebo Proboj (North West), Noela, Tera, Laura and Zora (South East).
					</p>
					<p>
						Zora, the largest outlying island is somewhat developed, mostly supported through a number of military camps and depots.
					</p>
					<p>
						Next, Mermaid is used as a live-fire training facility, with the permanent residents being the military air base personnel at MOB Mermaid.
					</p>
					<p>
						Finally, all other islands are either lightly developed, or un-developed.

				<div class="content d-grid">
					<h3>Economy</h3>
					<p>
						The Republic is classed as a MEDC, with an economy mostly based around tourism and oil extraction and refining.
					</p>
					<p>
						However, the economy is also boosted by foreign military training assets, such as short-term leases for MOB Mermaid.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite the MEDC status, a number of villages on the outlying islands are mainly based around fishing and agriculture.
					</p>

					<h3>Political & Legal Systems</h3>
					<p>
						Fapovo is a constitutional democratic republic, with seperated executive, legislative and judicial branches.
						The Executive Branch is known as the Federal Board, the Legislative Branch as the General Assembly,
						and the highest court being the Court of Constitutional Appeals.
					</p>
					<p>
						Elections for the Assembly are held every 4 years, and are generally rated highly by democracy monitors.
						Elections for the Federal Board are held at maximum every 8 years, though can be called forward by either
						popular vote, or by a vote of no confidence by the assembly.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Board consists of a number of members:
					</p>
					<dl>
						<dt>President of State, Executor of Assembly</dt><dd>Leader of the Executive, statutorily limited by the Assembly, but otherwise free in day-to-day running of the Country.</dd>

					<h3>History</h3>
					<p>
						Briefly, the Islands were a British Colony, under the adminstrative control of the USA.
						Governmental functions were ceeded to a local government body in the aftermath of the Pig War.
						After the Second World War, the island was under de-facto control of The USSR
						as a trade supply base and resupply depot. After the collapse of the USSR, the inhabitants voted
						for a new constitution.
					</p>

					<h3>Political Status</h3>
					<p>
						Currently, the island is held by a libertarian centrist coalition, though control often swings center-left through center-right between elections.
						The executive held by a center-left candidate, President Isaac Khan.
						The judicial branch however, is generally regarded as right-wing, headed by Chief Justice Gilbert Terrell.
					</p>

					<h3>Political Issues</h3>
					<p>
						Whilst typically stable, a number of separatist groups have been funded, in both the North and South of the country,
						promoting return to an island split between Russia and the United States.

					<h2>National Defence, Policing, Intelligence and Civil Militia</h2>

					<h3>Gendarmerie Civilé</h3>
					<p>
						The Nation's primary policing force is the Gendarmé, a paramilitary policing force,
						under the Executive Control of Director General of the Gendarmerie Civilé.
					</p>
					<p>
						The Gendarmerie are generally noted as being competent and well-trained,
						however their equipment for counter-terror and counter-insurgency operations is limited, generally
						calling upon the Military Police for such situations.
					</p>

					<h3>Rangers</h3>
					<p>
						The Rangers are a poorly equipped paramilitary policing force, with jurisdiction outside
						urban areas, acting as both a sworn police force in their own right, and as a forestry service.
					</p>
					<p>
						Due to their focus on forestry policing, and generally positive relationship with the public,
						weapons carried by the rangers tend to be for defence against animals, rather than people.
					</p>
					<p>
						Despite the lack of equipment, the rangers tend to have the highest morale of all the branches.
					</p>

					<h3>Armed Forces of the Democratic Federal Republic of Fapovo</h3>
					<p>
						The defence of the Nation from external threats, and some internal security is handled by the Armed Forces,
						generally following the Finnish system, a professional core supplemented with mandatory conscription.
					</p>
					<p>
						The forces generally use current or last generation equipment, with units undergoing modernisation as blocks.
						Post-modernised units use Geometric Woodland Camo.
						Pre-modernised units use various colours of French Lizard camo.
					</p>
					<p>
						The professional core, as with the Gendarmerie, are well-trained and competent.
						However, conscripts are often trained to poorer standards, and are likely to suffer morale issues.
					</p>

					<h3>Ministries of Intelligence and Counter-Intelligence</h3>
					<p>
						Nominally, the ministries are effective in their respective roles. They are well-financed, and
						attract competent candidates for their roles. Equipment is modern, and training is handled well.

					</p>
					<p>
						However, the two ministries appear to be in conflict between themselves, seemingly over points
						such as areas of responsibility, budgetary funding and police / military support.
						Conflicts appear to be typically minor, but have in the past escalated to assaults and property
						destruction.

					<h2>Current Situation</h2>
					<p>
						Over the past few weeks violence greatly increased within two groups of separatists, against
						both the opposing groups and the government.
					</p>
					<p>
						The government has been unable to restore order, and is fearful of tensions between the groups
						erupting into a full scale civil war.
					</p>
					<p>
						Overall, intelligence reports that the death toll for civilians ranges into the thousands, along
						with attacks on government members, police, military members and civic infrastructure.
					</p>

					<h3>Government Response</h3>
					<p>
						The Government has requested support in a request sent to both the U.N. and to various participant
						nations. In response, the UN has authorized deployment of peacekeeping forces, with forces deployed
						from The United Kingdom, The United States and Germany.
					</p>

					<h3>Third Party Response</h3>
					<p>
						The International Development and Aid Project (IDAP) have activated a crisis team, and are currently
						awaiting permission to enter, contingent on a secure point of operations to work from.
					</p>

					<h3>Deployment Information</h3>
					<p>
						The 304th Sustainment Brigade has set up a base of operations in the town of Bumin, henceforth
						referred to as <em>Point Talon</em>. Further FOBs will be deployed as required.

						<li>Light Transport Vehicles</li>
						<li>Explosives</li>
					</ul>
					<h5>Alignment</h5>
					<p>OPFOR Alpha, Opposing OPFOR Beta, INDFOR, Neutral BLUFOR</p>
					<h5>Structure</h5>
					<p>
						This group appear to work in isolated cells, with little typical communication, focusing on asymmetric warfare;
						attacking targets of opportunity, initiating firefights or detonating explosives,
						then quickly withdrawing before overwhelming firepower can be brought to bear.
					</p>
					<h5>Targets</h5>
					<p>
						The group attempt to avoid civilian casualties, instead focusing targets on the Government and OPFOR Beta.
					</p>
					<h5>Criteria for Victory</h5>
					<p>
						The key to winning against this group are building up intelligence to allow the arrest of leaders, reducing the flow of ideas and arms.
					</p>
					<h5>Operating Area</h5>
					<p>
						Whilst the group has a stronger base of support in the north; they have been seen in the south
						with regular occurrence, likely due to their cell based structure.
					</p>
					<h5>Tactical Assessment</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Current Successes come down to speed, surprise and violence of action.</li>
						<li>Strong holdouts will likely be converted by improving social conditions.</li>
						<li>Terroristic / Insurgent tactics will likely be dangerous to deployed forces, even if deaths of BLUEFOR aren't intended by the group.</li>
						<li>The group have not objected to UN intervention, and may be open to negotiation.</li>
						<li>General supplies for the group do not seem limited, likely due to strong auxiliary members / mass-base support.</li>

					<h5>Assets Summary</h5>
					<ul>
						<li>Personal Weapons</li>

					</ul>

					<h5>Alignment</h5>
					<p>OPFOR Beta, Opposing OPFOR Alpha, INDFOR, BLUFOR</p>

					<h5>Structure</h5>
					<p>
						This group is structured more as a traditional militia, with a formalized rank structure.
						The group is more likely to engage in protracted fights, though will still utilise insurgent tactics
						in reprisal attacks against suspected northern sympathisers.
					</p>

					<h5>Targets</h5>
					<p>
						This group is more indiscriminate in their attacks, appearing to have no formal target, attacking
						any group it deems most advantageous at the current time. They have also denounced our involvement in Fapovo.
					</p>

					<h5>Criteria for Victory</h5>
					<p>
						Suggested criteria are conventional de-radicalisation, intelligence and anti-trafficking efforts.
						Continuing COIN to medium-long term.
					</p>

					<h5>Operating Area</h5>
					<p>
						This group solely operate in the south of the country, with no attempt to move past into the north.
					</p>

					<h5>Tactical Assessment</h5>
					<p>
						This group is a direct danger to our operations, with reprisal attacks constituting a direct threat
						to both civilians and BLUEFOR operatives. The immediate denouncement suggest that negotiations are
						also unlikely.
