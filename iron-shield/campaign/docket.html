				<h2>Background Information</h2>
				<h3>Malden</h3>

				<h4>Geography & Population</h4>
				<p>
					Malden is Mediterranean Micro-Nation, population of 560,000, formed from the major island of Malden, with 6 smaller outlying islands.
				</p>
				<p>
					The largest outlying island was used as a Military Training area, and is now abandoned.
					The next-largest outlying island is home to the Pegasus Air Company, a minor airstrip.
				</p>

				<h4>Economy</h4>
				<p>
					The micronation is classed as a LEDC, with an economy based on farming and some tourism.
					However the economy has been artificially boosted through foreign military training on the island, most recently though the lease of a number of lands to a PMC.
				</p>
				<p>
					Despite the boosts from the foreign militaries, both through direct payments to the Government, and indirect payments to locals for food and services, poverty is rife.
				</p>

				<h4>Politics & Legal System</h4>
				<p>
					Malden is a de-jure constitutional democratic republic, with conjoined executive and legislative branches, with an independent judiciary.
					The Executive branch (Government) is known as the Ruling Council, the Legislative branch is known as the General Assembly.
				</p>
				<p>
					Elections are held every 2 years, with individual seats held for 6 years.
					The Ruling Council is formed from the ruling party / coalition, with the Council being formed of:

					<ul>
						<li>The President of the State (Leader of the Executive)</li>
						<li>Minister of the Budget (Budget, Taxation Policy, Joint Responsibility for Land Lease)</li>
						<li>Minister of the Interior (Education, Health, Infrastructure, Joint Responsibility for Land Lease)</li>
						<li>Minister of the Exterior (Armed Forces, Foreign Relations, Aid)</li>
						<li>Minister of the Law (Policing, Legal Policy, Interface to the Courts)</li>
					</ul>
				</p>

				<h4>Current Political Status</h4>
				<p>
					Currently, the Executive is held by the majority party, the Progressive Alliance, a populist centrist party lead by President Jason Vernon, with 87% of the vote as of the 2020 elections, a position it has enjoyed since 1924.
				</p>
				<p>
					The other parties are the Maldian United Socialists, a left-wing party who hold 9% of the vote, and the National Party of Malden, a right-wing party who hold the remaining 4% of the vote.
				</p>

				<h4>Political Issues</h4>
				<p>
					Despite Malden's is a de-jure democractic, it is an autocracy de-facto, with concerns raised over the independence of the judiciary (the current Chief of the Court is the brother of the President), fraud concerns raised over elections, and general Government corruption.
				</p>
				<p>
					Even with the large amount of money flowing into Malden through military contracts, numerous areas of the island are underdeveloped and budget shortfalls are the norm, with legislation failing to implement any reforms.
				</p>


				<h4>Defence and Policing</h4>
				<h5>Gendarmé</h5>
				<p>
					The Nation's primary Policing force is the Gendarmé, under the Executive Control from the Minister of the Law. However, this responsibility has been delegated to Commandant de la Force (incumbent Colonel Sokratis Antonis) for the past 27 years.
				</p>
				<p>
					Through this, the Gendarmé enjoy pseudo-independence in most matters, though influence can be asserted through both the legislative and executive branches, through the laws enforced and the Commandant respectively.
					Individual Officers can be considered to be neutral to the Government itself, but bound to the orders of their superior officers.
				</p>

				<h5>Malden Defence Forces</h5>
				<p>
					The Nation's defence is handled by the Malden Defence Forces, a joint professional army and civic militia.
				</p>
				<p>
					The majority of ongoing matters, such as training, logistics and equipment are handled by a 3 division-strength standing army,
					with forces bolstered by the activation of a civic militia.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Commander in Chief of the MDF is the Minister of the Exterior de-jure, however, as with the Gendarme, responsibility has been delegated to the Marshal of the Malden Defence Forces (incumbent General Marshal Yorgos Spyros).
				</p>


				<h2>Current Situation</h2>
				<h3>Background</h3>
				<p>
					Two weeks ago, violence erupted between two opposing factions:
				</p>
				<p>
					Firstly, an anti-Government terror organisation, formed from members of the political group known as the Maldian United Socialists, with the first acts being a bomb placed under the car of the Minister of the Budget.
					This group mostly works in isolated cells, with support from a sector of the community, mainly from the underserved central and western areas.
					Unfortunately, due to the aforementioned election fraud issues, actual levels of local support are unknown.
				</p>
				<p>
					Secondly, a pro-Government "militia" formed from members of both the Progressive Alliance and National Party of Malden,
					known as the Defenders of Malden, have conducted indiscriminate, retaliatory, extrajudicial killings.
				</p>
				<p>
					Death tolls for civilians ranges into the hundreds, along with attacks on members of the government and critical infrastructure. Due to the nature of these quick raids from both sides, the Gendarme is unable to restore order.
					The Malden Defence Force is unable to be activated, due to the number of members of both sides who would gain ready access to firearms and armoured vehicles.
					Despite these issues, the membership of both Defence and Police forces have not been involved with either side of the conflict, and stated before, should be integrated into the Task Force.
				</p>

				<h3>Governmental Response</h3>
				<p>
					The Government of Malden have sent a request to both the UN and various countries directly, for assistance in restoring order and keeping the peace.
				</p>
				<p>
					In response, the United Kingdom, United States, Czech Republic, Ireland and Canada authorised Military Aid to the Civil Power operations, combined with activation of UN peacekeepers, jointly forming Operation Iron Shield.
				</p>
				<p>
					The Irish 2nd Engineer Group has been deployed with the US Army 304th Sustainment Brigade, constructing the Home Operating Base of Point Talon, at the town of La Riviere.
					102nd Battalion are to deploy to Point Talon, to provide base security, peacekeeping forces and conducting MACP operations.
				</p>
				<p>
					The International Development & Aid Project (IDAP) also activated a crisis team, and have set-up their presences out of a compound next to Point Talon.
				</p>

					At the earliest availability, the Gendarme and Malden Defences Forces will be seconded to the JTF.
				</p>
				<p>
					Operational Command will be lead by Brigadier Tyler Wilson and Brigadier General Joseph Campbell, with all units in the JTF seconded to their command.
				</p>

				<h3>Deployed Forces</h3>
				<p>
					BLUEFOR forces are currently JTF Command (codename Northwind), forward elements of the 304th Sustainment Brigade and elements of the 102nd Battalion.
				</p>

				<h3>Available Assets</h3>
				<h4>Point Talon</h4>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="../_assets/img/talon_local.png">
				<p>
					Point Talon is the home operating base, set up by the 2nd Engineer Group, in the town of La Riviere. Currently, the assets at Talon are limited to:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Mobile HQ (occupied: Northwind)</li>
					<li>Logistics Area (occupied: 304th Sus.)</li>
					<li>Armoury (commanded: 304th Sus.)</li>

				</p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="../_assets/img/talon_map.png">
				<p>
					Currently, there is no permanent lodging, so tents or other arrangements must be made.
				</p>
				<p>
					These situations are likely to improve over time as (semi-)permanent structures are erected and more troops are deployed.
				</p>

				<h4>Operating Environment</h4>
				<p>
					Malden is a tropical island, with yellow/green ground and some woodland. For this environment, MTP, OCP, or OEF-CP are recommended.
					Arid, Tan and Woodland may be suitable in some areas.
					Arctic and Black should be avoided.
				</p>
				<p>
					Temperatures can vary from 5 to 45 degrees Celsius (41 to 113 degrees Fahrenheit), often with intense heatwaves.
					For this reason, camo nets are being issued, and are recommended to be used to provide shade and protection from the sun.
				</p>

				<h4>Logistical Support</h4>
				<p>
					The Island has some logistical issues, with a single airfield on the main island.
					Due to this, Point Talon has been established in a mid-size harbour, to allow for water-based logistical support, with supplies entering through the Azur Golf.
				</p>
				<img class="img-responsive" src="../_assets/img/talon_global.png">

				<h3>Organisations and Factions</h3>
				<h4>Maldian Government</h4>
				<p>
					The Maldian Government is a de-facto autocratic regime under President Json Vernon.
					Whilst officially declaring its intentions to restore Law and Order, a number of their members joined the Defenders of Malden.
				</p>

				<h5>Assets Summary</h5>
				<p>
					The Government has no tactical assets to field, though may attempt to regain control through the Gendarme and Defence Forces.
					It may also attempt to bring foreign influence in, as it already has through the UN.
				</p>

				<h5>Alignment</h5>
				<p>
					Official Stance is that the Government are Neutral.<br>
					Intelligence suggests alignment is Unknown.
				</p>

				<h4>Gendarmé</h4>
				<p>
					The Gendarme are a paramilitary organisation responsible for civil policing on Malden.
					As stated above, they are somewhat autonomous from the Government.
				</p>

				<h5>Structure</h5>
				<p>

					</p>
				<p>
					All sub-segmentations of command are headed by Captains, with the exception of National, which are headed by Lieutenants.
				</p>
				<p>
					Inside North, South, and Central Commands are Stations.<br>
					Outlying Command partitions into Sectors.<br>
					Tactical Command is instead split into Sections.<br>
					National Command is segmented into Groups, based on role (Maintenance Group, Logistics Group, Information Group, etc).

				<h5>Assets Summary</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>13 Stations (Platoon Size)</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Patrol Vehicles</li>
						<li>Local Armoury</li>
						<li>Jail</li>

					</ul>
				</ul>

				<h5>Tactical Assessment</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Forces are numerically limited, with most stations only fielding a maximum of 30 staff.</li>
					<li>Training is above average, with strong skills in Marksmanship, Driving and De-escalation.</li>
					<li>Materiel Strength is average, with access to armoured vehicles and some heavy weapons.</li>
					<li>Materiel Quality and Quantity are good, being integrated into the Defence Force Supply Chain.</li>
					<li>Field Experience is variable, tactical teams lack patrol experience, and patrols often lack tactical experience.</li>
					<li>Command Elements are strong at lower levels, though a lack of cross-experience hinders upper levels.</li>
					<li>Community Relations are good, as the Gendarmes follow a model of Policing by Consent, and are somewhat isolated from the Government itself.</li>
					<li>Overall, Gendarme Forces are fairly strong, enjoy isolation from the Government,
						and should be included in any UN command structure to ensure continuation of that, and to allow for the use of the Gendarme in this theatre.
						However, if this is done, no expansion should occur until after the resolution of the conflict.</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Alignment</h5>
				<p>
					The Gendarme are currently considered BLUFOR-aligned.
				</p>

				<h4>Malden Defence Forces</h4>
				<p>
					The Malden Defence Forces are a combined militia and professional army, responsible for external defence of Malden.
					Currently, the militia is unable to be raised, thus causing a limit of 3 battalions.
				</p>

				<h5>Structure</h5>
				<p>
					The standing army of the MDF are split into the following divisions:
				</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Central Command ("0th Battalion")</li>
					<ul>
						<li>A Company (HQ)</li>

				</ul>

				<img class="img-responsive" src="../_assets/img/mdf_recon_1.jpg">

				<h5>Tactical Assessment</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Forces would be strong with militia activation, however that's currently not possible.</li>
					<li>Training is average, with an emphasis on marksmanship and individual proficiency.</li>
					<li>Materiel Strength is strong, with access to assets from rifles to jets.</li>
					<li>Materiel Quality and Quantity are good, with a strong supply chain, excellent logistics corps and large equipment reserves.</li>
					<li>Field Experience is poor, whilst units conduct field exercises, the Malden Defence Forces have not seen actual combat.</li>
					<li>Fast Air capabilities are limited, due to a lack of trained crew. However, some availability is provided through 2nd Battalion, A Company.</li>
					<li>A significant of trained helicopter crews are available, with most activated crews in Central Command, B Company or 2nd Battalion, A Company.</li>
					<li>Armoured vehicles and trained crews are numerous, though aside from 1st Battalion C Company, are unable to be activated.</li>
					<li>Artillery, both towed and self-propelled are readily available to crews, though training for these specialities is limited.</li>
					<li>Infantry are numerous, often well armed, and fairly well organised.</li>
					<li>Naval elements are limited to Speedboats, RHIBs and other similar equipment.</li>
					<li>Overall, Malden Defence Forces, as with the Gendarme, are fairly strong, continue to enjoy isolation from the Government,
						and should be included within the Task Force if able.
						As with the Gendarme, we recommend no expansion should occur until after the resolution of the conflict.</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Alignment</h5>
				<p>
					The Malden Defence Forces are currently considered BLUFOR-aligned.
				</p>

				<h4>Maldian United Socialists</h4>
				<p>
					The Maldian United Socialists are a Political Party turned Terror Group, with the stated goal of improving conditions for all throughout the island and
					replacing the Government with one who listens to the people.
				</p>
				<p>
					This group have been fairly successful, enjoying great amounts of popular support to the center and west of the island.
				</p>

				<h5>Structure</h5>
				<p>
					The group work in isolated cells, with little communication associated with typical militaries, focusing instead on uerilla / asymmetrical tactics,
					attacking targets of opportunity, initiating firefight or detonating explosives, then quickly withdrawing before overwhelming firepower can be brought to bear.
				</p>

				<h5>Targets</h5>
				<p>
					The group attempt to avoid civilian casualties, instead targeting the Government and Defenders of Malden.
				</p>

				<h5>Criteria for Victory</h5>
				<p>
					The keys to winning against this group are to build up intelligence to allow the arrest of leaders, reducing the flow of ideas and arms.
				</p>

				<h5>Assets Summary</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Unknown Manpower.</li>
					<li>Strong Popular Support.</li>
					<li>Explosives.</li>
					<li>WWII / Cold War Surplus Equipment.</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Tactical Assessment</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Current Successes come down to speed, surprise and violence of action.</li>
					<li>Strong holdouts will likely be converted by improving social conditions.</li>
					<li>Terroristic / Insurgent tactics will likely be dangerous to deployed forces, even if deaths of BLUEFOR aren't intended by the group.</li>
					<li>The group have not objected to UN intervention, and may be open to negotiation.</li>
					<li>General supplies for the group do not seem limited, likely due to strong auxiliary members / mass-base support.</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Alignment</h5>
				<p>
					Forces are to be currently considered Neutral / OPFOR.<br>
					Further intelligence work is ongoing to clarify this.
				</p>

				<h4>Defenders of Malden</h4>
				<p>
					The Defenders of Malden are a reactionary "militia", aimed at killing the Maldian United Socialists and continuing the power of the Progressive Alliance.
				</p>
				<p>
					This group have been less successful, but extremely violent, with indiscriminate retaliatory killings.
				</p>

				<h5>Structure</h5>
				<p>
					As with the United Socialists, this group work in isolated cells, though with a stronger leadership chain.
					This group tend to utilise quick attacks, though this normally compromises reprisal attacks rather than insurgent tactics.
				</p>

				<h5>Targets</h5>
				<p>
					This group make no definition of target, attacking any group it deems most advantageous at the current time.<br>
					This group have also denounced our involvement in Malden.
				</p>

				<h5>Criteria for Victory</h5>
				<p>
					Removal of the current Government could devolve this group from reprisal group to insurgency, though this goes against our objectives.
				</p>
				<p>
					This group may dissolve if the Maldian United Socialists are defeated, though this is not certain.
				</p>
				<p>
					Alternatives include conventional de-radicalisation, intelligence and anti-trafficking efforts.
				</p>

				<h5>Assets Summary</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>Unknown Manpower.</li>
					<li>WWII / Cold War Equipment.</li>
					<li>Some Modern Equipment.</li>
					<li>Modified Civilian Vehicles.</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Tactical Analysis</h5>
				<ul>
					<li>This group is a direct danger to our operations.</li>
					<li>Reprisal attacks constitute a direct threat to both civilians and BLUEFOR operatives.</li>
					<li>Negotiations with this group are unlikely.</li>
				</ul>

				<h5>Alignment</h5>
				<p>Forces are currently considered OPFOR.</p>

				<h4>International Development & Aid Project (IDAP)</h4>
				<p>
					IDAP is a non-governmental organization focusing on humanitarian efforts.
					They have a main base of operations next to Point Talon.
				</p>
				<p>
					IDAP is considered a humanitarian organisation by all government actors in this conflict, however, that does not mean the MUS and DOM will respect that.
					Ensuring that IDAP are effective and secure will be important in stabilising the area in the future.
				</p>
				<p>
					However, IDAP appear to have already foreseen issue, and have contracted with ION Security to ensure their protection.
				</p>

				<h5>Assets Summary</h5>
				<ul>
